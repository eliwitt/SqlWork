Listing 6: Solution with Tiebreaker: MAX(OrderID), Using TOP 1 and a Join
SELECT EmployeeID, OrderID, CustomerID, ShipVia, OrderDate
FROM (SELECT (SELECT TOP 1 OrderID
              FROM Orders AS K
              WHERE K.EmployeeID = E.EmployeeID
              ORDER BY OrderDate DESC, OrderID DESC) AS topkey
      FROM Employees AS E) AS D
  JOIN Orders AS O
    ON O.OrderID = D.topkey
