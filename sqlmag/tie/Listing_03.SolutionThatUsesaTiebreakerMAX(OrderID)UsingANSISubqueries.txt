Listing 3: Solution That Uses a Tiebreaker: MAX(OrderID), Using ANSI Subqueries
SELECT EmployeeID, OrderID, CustomerID, ShipVia, OrderDate
FROM Orders AS O1
WHERE OrderID =
  (SELECT MAX(OrderID)
   FROM Orders AS O2
BEGIN CALLOUT A
   WHERE O2.EmployeeID = O1.EmployeeID
     AND O2.OrderDate =
       (SELECT MAX(OrderDate)
        FROM Orders AS O3
        WHERE O3.EmployeeID = O1.EmployeeID)
END CALLOUT A
)
